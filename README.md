In this project, the snack game was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript was used to add interactivity to the game, allowing the character to move around the board and collect snacks. It was also used to implement the game's logic, such as keeping track of the player's score and detecting collisions with obstacles. HTML was used to structure the game's user interface, defining the game board and placing elements such as the character, snacks, and obstacles. CSS was used to style the game board and its elements, creating a visually appealing and engaging user interface.

In addition to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the snack game also utilized the ReactJS library. ReactJS was used to manage the game's state, allowing the game board and its elements to be updated in real-time as the game progressed. React components were used to create the game's different elements, such as the game board, character, snacks, and obstacles. Overall, the combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS allowed for the development of an engaging and addictive game that is easy to play but challenging to master.
